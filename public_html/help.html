            Minesweeper is a single-player game that begins with a board of tiles with hidden values. Each tile conatins one of the following
             values: a bomb, a numeric value representing the amount of bombs in the surrounding area, or an empty space. The tiles will be
             revealed on-click by the user. The goal of the user is to reveal all tiles on the board except for the bombs. If the user is able
             to successfully do this, the game will be won. However, if a bomb is clicked, the game is lost and will end immediately.
             Optionally, the user may plant flags on specific tiles that they believe to be bombs. This will help keep track of the number of
             bombs left on the board and avoid any misclicks.

            On the game page, the user is able to create a new game by clicking the corresponding button and a difficulty of his or her choosing.
